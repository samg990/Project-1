FAMLY is a Mentor Crowsourcing App. 
It allows others to financially donate towards activities for Mentors to do with their Mentees. 

As a college student I mentored a high-schooler. Since I was paying for my college tuition, cash was tight for me, and me mentee came from a single-parent low-income home, leaving me to pay for any activities, and ultimately limiting the number of activities or the options of affordable activities. 

This App allows someone to create a mentor membership profile, and post wishlists, ie. a wishlist for tickets to a baseball game, or the cost of supplies for a DIY project. The wishlist, along with the mentor profile is uploaded to a billboard page, where potential donors can scroll through, to see a brief overview of the activity, the financial goal and current progress, mentor/mentee bio, etc. Once the potential donor decides on an activity to donate to, they simply click the "FAM" button, which leads to the payment page. 

Each Mentor has a membership profile, where they can post pictures of their outting with mentees and projects they've worked on together, as well as articles. This enables donors to see the direct result of their financial donation. The page is also open to other Mentors, who can read the article and see pictures, allowing them to get ideas for activities and projects with their mentees.
